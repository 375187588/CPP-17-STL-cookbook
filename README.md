- 使用STL的方式，简洁优雅的实现算法。

## 本书概述

作为对《C++17 STL Cook book》的中文翻译。

C++已经出道很久了，并且在各种领域都有涉及。人们使用其快捷、高效和灵活的特点解决了很多问题。C++将要到来的新版本，势必会让编程者改变其编程的方式。如果你想要掌握更加高明的编程方式或是想要代码可无死角移植，那么熟练使用C++17 STL是你必须要掌握的。选择本书旨在帮助你了解C++17 STL，并通过实例掌握其使用方式。

Beginning with new language features, this book will help you understand the language's mechanics and library features, and offers insight into how they work. Unlike other books, ours takes an implementation-specific, problem-solution approach that will help you quickly overcome hurdles. You will learn the core STL concepts, such as containers, algorithms, utility classes, lambda expressions, iterators, and more, while working on practical real-world recipes. These recipes will help you get the most from the STL and show you how to program in a better way.

By the end of the book, you will be up to date with the latest C++17 features and save time and effort while solving tasks elegantly using the STL.

## 你将学到什么

Learn about the new core language features and the problems they were intended to solve
Understand the inner workings and requirements of iterators by implementing them
Explore algorithms, functional programming style, and lambda expressions
Leverage the rich, portable, fast, and well-tested set of well-designed algorithms provided in the STL
Work with strings the STL way instead of handcrafting C-style code
Understand standard support classes for concurrency and synchronization, and how to put them to work
Use the filesystem library addition available with the C++17 STL

## 作者简介

Jacek Galowicz obtained his master of science in electrical engineering/computer engineering at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. While at university, he enjoyed working as a student assistant in teaching and research, and he participated in several scientific publications. During and after his studies, he worked as a freelancer and implemented applications as well as kernel drivers in C and C++, touching various areas, including 3D graphics programming, databases, network communication, and physics simulation. In recent years, he has been programming performance- and security-sensitive microkernel operating systems for Intel x86 virtualization at Intel and FireEye in Braunschweig, Germany. He has a strong passion for modern C++ implementations of low-level software, and he tries hard to combine high performance with an elegant coding style. Learning purely functional programming and Haskell in recent years triggered his drive to implement generic code with the aid of meta programming.
